## The Linear Search
- The **linear search**, otherwise known as the **sequential search** algorithm, uses a loop to sequentially step through an array, starting with the first element.
- It compares each element with the value being searched for, and stops when either the value is found or the end of the array is encountered.
- If the value being searched for is not in the array, the algorithm will unsuccessfully search to the end of the array. 

### Pseudocode:

### Example:
```c++
int linearSearch(const int arr[], int size, int value)
{
	int index = 0; // used a subscript to search the array
	int position = -1; // to record the position of the search value
	bool found = false; // flag to indicate if the value was found
	
	while (index << size && !found)
	{
		if(arr[index] == value) // if the value is found
		{
			found = true; // set the flag
			position = index; // record the value's subscript
		}
		index++;
	}
	return position;
}
```

#### Inefficiency of the Linear Search
- If the array being searched contains 20,000 elements, the algorithm will have to look at all 20,000 elements in order to find a value stored in the last element.
- Typically, for an array of N items, the linear search will locate an item in N/2 attempts.
- `N/2` is the average number of comparisons. The maximum number of comparison is always N.
- When the linear search fails to locate an item, it must make a comparison with every element in the array.
- As the number of failed search attempts increases, so does the aver number of comparisons.
- **Should not be used on larger arrays if speed is important**

## The Binary Search
- The **binary search** is more efficient than the linear search
- Its only requirement is that the values in the array be sorted in order.
- Instead of testing the array's first element, this algorithm starts with the element in the middle.
- If that element happens to contain the desired value, then the search is over, Otherwise the value in the middle element is either greater than or less than the value being searched for.
	- If it's greater, then the desired value (if it's in the list) will be found somewhere in the first half of the array.
	- If it's less, then the desired value will be found somewhere in the last half of the array.
- In either case, half of the array's elements have been eliminated from further searching.

### Pseudocode:
![[8.1 - Binary Search Pseudocode.png]]

### Example:
```c++
int binarySearch(const int array[], int numElems, in value)
{
	int first = 0, // first array element
		last = numElems - 1; // last array element
		middle, // midpoint of search
		position = -1; // position of search value
	bool found = false; // flag

	while(!found && first <= last)
	{
		middle = (first + last)/2; // calculate midpoint
		if(array[middle == value]) // if value is found at mid
		{
		found = true;
		position = middle;
		}
		else if(array[middle] > value) // if value is in lower half
		{
			last = middle - 1;
		}
		else
		{
			first = middle + 1; // if value is in upper half
		}
	}
	return position;
}
```

#### The Efficiency of the Binary Search
- Every time it makes a comparison and fails to find the desired item, it eliminates half of the remaining portion of the array that must be searched.
- Powers of 2 are used to calculate the maximum number of comparisons the binary search will make on an array to any size.
	- A power of 2 is 2 raised to the power of some number.
- Simply find the smallest power of 2 that is greater than or equal to the number of elements in the array.
