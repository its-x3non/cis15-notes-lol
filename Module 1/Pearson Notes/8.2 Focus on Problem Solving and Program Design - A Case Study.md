The manager of the Telemarketing Group has asked you to write a program that will help order-entry operators look up product prices. The program should prompt the user to enter a product number, and will then display the title, description, and price of the product.

## Variables
| Variable    | Description                                                                                     |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| NUM_PRODS   | A constant integer initialized with the number of DLC Inc sells. This value will be used in the |
|             | definition of the program's array.                                                              |
| MIN_PRODNUM | A constant integer initialized with the lowest product number.                                  |
| MAX_PRODNUM | A constant integer initialized with the highest product number.                                 |
| id          | Array of integers. Holds each product's number.                                                 |
| title       | Array of strings, initialized with the titles products                                          |
| description | Array of strings, initialized with the descriptions of each product.                            |
| prices      | Array of doubles. Holds each product's price                                                    |

## Modules
| Function     | Description                                                                       |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| main         | The program's main function. It calls the program's other functions               |
| getProdNum   | Prompts the user to enter a product number. The function validates input          |
|              | and rejects any value outside the range of the correct product numbers.           |
| binarySearch | A standard binary search routine. Searches an array for a specified value.        |
|              | If the value is found, its subscript is returned. If the value is not found,      |
|              | -1 is returned.                                                                   |
| displayProd  | Uses a common subscript into the title, description, and prices arrays to display |
|              | the title, description, and the price of a product.                               |


## Function Main:
```c++
do
{
	// get the desired product number
	prodNum = getProdNum();

	// search for the product number
	indext = binarySearch(id, NUM_PRODS, prodNum);

	// display the results of the search
	if(index == -1)
	{
		cout << "That product number was not fonud.\n";
	}
	else
	{
		displayProd(title, description, prices, index);
	}

	// does the user want to use this again
	cout << "Would you like to look up another product? (y/n) ";
	cin >> again;
} while (again =='y' || again =='Y');
```
The name constant `NUM_PRODS` is defined globally and initalized with the value 9. The arrays id, `title, description,` and `prices` will already be initialized with the data.

### The `getProdNum` Function:
```C++
int getProdNum()
{
	int prodNum;
	cout << "Enter the item's product number: ";
	cin >> prodNum;

	// validate input
	while (prodNum < MIN_PRODNUM || prodNum > MAX_PRODNUM)
	{
		cout << "Enter a number in the range of " << MIN_PRODNUM;
		cout << " through " << MAX_PRODNUM << ".\n";
		cin >> prodNum;
	}
	return prodNum;
}
```

### The `displayProd` Function:
```C++
void displayProd(const string title[], const string desc[], const double price[], int index)
{
	cout << "Title: " << title[index] << endl;
	cout << "Description " << desc[index] << endl;
	cout << "Price: $" << price[index] << endl;
}
```
