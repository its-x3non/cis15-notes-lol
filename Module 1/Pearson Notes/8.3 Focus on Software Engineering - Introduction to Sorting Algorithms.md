# Sorting Algorithms
- A **sorting algorithm** is a technique for stepping through an array and rearranging its contents in some order

# Bubble Sort
- The **Bubble Sort** is an easy way to arrange data in ascending or descending order. <br />

At this point, the entire array has been scanned once, and the largest value, 9, is in the correct position. There are other elements, however, that are not yet in their final positions. So, the algorithm will make another pass through the array, comparing each element with its neighbor. In the next pass, it will stop comparing after reaching the next-to-last element because the last element already contains the correct value.

The second pass starts by comparing elements 0 and 1. Because those two are in the proper order, they are not swapped. Elements 1 and 2 are compared next, but once again, they are not swapped. This continues until elements 3 and 4 are compared. Because element 3 is greater than element 4, they are swapped. Element 4 is the last element that is compared during this pass, so this pass stops. The array now appears as shown in **Figure 8-5**. <br />

Each time the algorithm makes a pass through the array, the portion of the array that is scanned is decreased in size by one element, and the largest value in the scanned portion of the array is moved to its final position. When all of the passes have been made, the array will appear as shown in **Figure 8-7**.  <br />

## Real Time Bubble Sort Example:
```c++
// This program demonstrates the Bubble Sort Algorithm.
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// Function prototpes
void bubbleSort(int[],int);
void swap(int &, int &);

int main()
{
	const int SIZE = 6;

	// Array of unsorted Values
	int values[SIZE] = {6,1,5,2,4,3};

	// Display the Unsorted Array
	cout << "The unsorted values:\n";
	for(auto element : values)
		cout << element << " ";
	cout << endl;

	// Sort the Array
	bubbleSort(values,SIZE);

	// Display the sorted Array
	cout << "The sorted values:\n";
	for(auto element :values)
		cout << element << " ";
	cout << endl;
	
	return 0;
}

//**************************************************************//
//The bubbleSort function sorts an int array in ascending Order.//
//**************************************************************//
void bubbleSort(int array[], int size)
{
	int maxElement;
	int index;

	for(maxElement = size - 1; maxElement > 0; maxElement--)
	{
		for(inedx = 0; index < maxElement; index++)
		{
			if(array[index] > array[index + 1])
			{
				swap(array[index], array[index + 1]);
			}
		}
	}
}

//******************************************//
//The swap function swaps a and b in memory.//
//******************************************//
void swap(int &a, int &b)
{
	int temp = a;
	a = b;
	b = temp;
}
```

### Pseudocode:
![8.3 - Bubble Sort Pseudocode](/Module%201/Pearson%20Notes/8.3%20Photos/8.3%20-%20Bubble%20Sort%20Pseudocode.png)

### Example Code:
```C++
void bubbleSort(int array[], int size)
{
    int maxElement;
    int index;
    
    for (maxElement = size − 1; maxElement > 0; maxElement––)
    {
        for (index = 0; index < maxElement; index++)
        {
            if (array[index] > array[index + 1])
            {
                swap(array[index], array[index + 1]);
            }
        }
    }
}
```
- In lines 3 and 4, the following local variables are defined:
	-   The maxElement variable will hold the subscript of the last element that is to be compared to its immediate neighbor.
	-   The index variable is used as an array subscript in one of the loops.
- The function uses two for loops, one nested inside another. 
	- The outer loop begins in line 6 as follows: `for (maxElement = size - 1; maxElement > 0; maxElement--`
- This loop will iterate once for each element in the array. It causes the maxElement variable to take on all of the array’s subscripts, from the highest subscript down to 0. After each iteration, maxElement is decremented by one.
	- The second loop, which is nested inside the first loop, begins in line 8 as follows: `for (index = 0; index < maxElement; index++`
- This loop iterates once for each of the unsorted array elements. It starts index at 0 and increments it up through maxElement − 1. 
	- During each iteration, the comparison in line 10 is performed: `if (array[index] > array[index + 1])`
		- This if statement compares the element at array \[index] with its neighbor array \[index + 1]. If the element’s neighbor is greater, the swap function is called in line 12 to swap the two elements.

# Swapping Array Elements
### Function for Swapping 2 integers:
```c++
void swap(int &a, int &b)
{
	int temp = a;
	a = b;
	b = temp;
}
```
