# [8.3 - Bubble Sort](../Pearson%20Notes/8.3%20Focus%20on%20Software%20Engineering.md#Bubble-Sort)
## Introduction to Sorting Algorithms
- **Sort:** Arrange values into an order
	- Alphabetical
	- Ascending Numeric
	- Descending Numeric
- Two algorithms considered here:
	- Bubble Sort
	- Selection Sort

## Bubble Sort
Concept:
- Compare 1st two elements
	- If out of order, exchange them to put in order
- Move down 1 element, compare 2nd and 3rd elements, exchange if necessary. Continue until end of array.
- Pass through array again, exchanging as necessary
- Repeat until pass made with no exchanges

## [Bubble Sort Function](../Pearson%20Notes/8.3%20Focus%20on%20Software%20Engineering.md#Bubble-Sort-Code)

## Bubble Sort - Tradeoffs
- Benefits:
	- East to understand and implement
- Disadvantage:
	- Inefficient: slow for large arrays
