## Sorting and Searching Vectors
- Sorting and searching algorithms can be applied to vectors as well as arrays
- Need slight modifications to functions to use vector arguments:
	- `vector <type> &` used in prototype
	- No need to indicate vector size, functions can use `size` member function to calculate.
