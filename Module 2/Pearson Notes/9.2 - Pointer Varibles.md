# 9.2 - Pointer Variables
A <u>pointer variable</u>, just often called a *pointer*, is a special variable that holds a memory address. Pointer variables are designed to hold memory address.
Memory addresses identify specific locations in the computer's memory.
This can be used to hold the location of some other piece of data.
Pointer variables allow you to also work with the data that they point to.

## Example 1: showValues Function
```c++
const int SIZE = 5;
int numbers[SIZE] = {1,2,3,4,5};
showValues(number,SIZE);
```

#### Definition for the `showValues` function:
```c++
void showValues(int values[], int size)
{
	for(int count = 0; count < size; count++)
		cout << values[count] << endl;
}
```

## Example 2: getOrder Function
```c++
int jellyDonuts;
getOrder(jellyDonuts);
```

#### Definition for the `getOrder` function:
```c++
void getOrder(int &donuts)
{
	cout << "How many doughnuts do you want?";
	cin >> donuts;
}
```

In the connection between the donuts reference variable and the `jellyDonuts` argument is automatically established when the function is called. When writing this code, you don't have to go through the trouble of finding the memory address of the `jellyDonuts`  variable then properly storing that address in the donuts reference variable.
When storing a value in the donuts variable, we don't have to specify that the value should actually be stored in the `jellyDonuts` variable.

Pointers are useful as well as necessary for many operations, one operation is dynamic memory allocation.
When working with an unknown amount of data, dynamic memory allocation allows for the creation of variables, arrays, and more complex data structures in memory while the program is running.

Pointers are also very useful in algorithms that manipulate arrays and work with certain types of strings.
# Creating and Using Pointer Variables
```c++
int *ptr;
```
The asterisk in front of the variable name indicates that `ptr` is a pointer variable. The `int` data type indicates that `ptr` can be used to hold the address of an integer variable. The definition statement above would read “`ptr` is a pointer to an `int`.”

It could also be written as:
```c++
int* ptr;
```
This style of definition might visually reinforce the fact that `ptr`’s data type is not `int`, but pointer-to-int. Both definition styles are correct.

It's not a good idea to define a pointer variable w/o initializing with a valid memory address. If inadvertently using an uninitialized pointer variable, it will affect some unknown location in memory. It's a good idea to initialized pointer variables with the special value `nullptr`.
`nullptr` was introduced to represent the address 0. When assigned to a pointer variable, it makes the variable point to the address 0.
```c++
int *ptr = nullptr;
```

### Program 9-2: Usage of a Pointer
```c++
// This program stores the address of a variable in a pointer
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
	int x = 25;         // int variable
	int *ptr = nullptr; // pointer variable, can point to an int

	ptr = &x;           // store the address of x in ptr
	cout << "The value in x is " << x << endl;
	cout << "The address of x is " << ptr << endl;
	return 0;
}

// =============== Output ===============
// 
// ======================================
```

#### Figure 9-4
`ptr` points to x <br />
![9.2 - Figure 9-4](/Module%202/Pearson%20Notes/9.2%20Photos/9.2%20-%20Figure%209-4.png)
The variable `x` is located at memory address `0x7e00` that contains the number 25.
The `ptr` pointer contains the address `0x7e00`.

The real benefit of pointers is that they allow for indirectly accessing and modifying the variable being pointed to. `ptr` could be used to change the contents of the variable `x`. This is done with the <u>indirection operator</u>, which is an asterisk (\*). 
When the indirection operator is place in front of appointer variable name, it <u>dereferences</u> the pointer. When working with a dereferenced pointer, we are working with the value the pointer is point to.

### Program 9-3: Dereferenced Pointer
```c++
// This program demonstrates the use of the indirection operator
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
	int x = 25;          // int variable
	int *ptr = nullptr;  // pointer variable, can point to an int

	ptr = &x;             // store the address of x in ptr

	// use both x and ptr to display the value in x
	cout << "Here is the value in x, printer twice:\n"
	cout << x << endl;    // displays the contents of x
	cout << *ptr << endl; // displays the context of x

	// assign 100 to the location pointer to by ptr.
	// This will assign 100 to x
	*ptr = 100;

	// use both x and ptr to display the value in x
	cout << "Once again, here is the value in x:\n"
	cout << x << endl;    // displays the contents of x
	cout << *ptr << endl; // displays the context of x
	return 0;
}

// =============== Output ===============
//
// ======================================
```

When applying the indirection operator (\*) we are not working with the pointer variable itself, but with the item it points to. Since the statement sends the expression `*ptr` to the `cout` object, it doesn't display the value in `ptr`, but the value that `ptr` points to. Since `ptr` points to the `x` variable, this statement displays the contents of the `x` variable.

If the statement had been written as:
```c++
cout << ptr << endl; // displays an address
```
Since the indirection operator is not applied in this statement, it works directly with the `ptr` variable.

### Program 9-4: Pointers pointing to Different Variables
```c++
 // This program demonstrates a pointer variable referencing
 // different variables.
 #include <iostream>
 using namespace std;
 
 int main()
 {
     int x = 25, y = 50, z = 75;  // Three int variables
     int *ptr = nullptr;          // Pointer variable
     // Display the contents of x, y, and z.
     cout << "Here are the values of x, y, and z:\n";
     cout << x << " " << y << " " << z << endl;
     
     // Use the pointer to manipulate x, y, and z.
     ptr = &x;       // Store the address of x in ptr.
     *ptr += 100;    // Add 100 to the value in x.
     ptr = &y;       // Store the address of y in ptr.
     *ptr += 100;    // Add 100 to the value in y.
     ptr = &z;       // Store the address of z in ptr.
     *ptr += 100;    // Add 100 to the value in z.

     // Display the contents of x, y, and z.
     cout << "Once again, here are the values of x, y, and z:\n";
     cout << x << " " << y << " " << z << endl;
     return 0;
 }

// =============== Output ===============
//
// ======================================
```

When you apply the indirection operator to `ptr`, we are not working with `ptr` but the item that `ptr` points to. When this statement executes, `ptr` is point at x, so the statement in line 18 adds 100 to the contents x.

## 3 uses (so far) of the asterisk in C++
- Multiplication: `distance = speed * time;`
- Definition of a pointer variable: `int *ptr = nullptr;`
- Indirection operator: `*ptr = 100`
