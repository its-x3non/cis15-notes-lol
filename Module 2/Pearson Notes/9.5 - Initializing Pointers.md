# 9.5 - Initializing Pointers
When a pointer is initialized with an address, it must be the address of an object the pointer can point to. For instance:
```c++
int myValue;
int *pint = &myValue;
```
This works because `myValues` is an integer.

As well as:
```c++
int ages[20];
int *pint = ages;
```
Because `ages` is an array of integers.

But not:
```c++
float myFloat;
int *pint = &myFloat;
```
Since `myFloat` is not an int.

Pointers may be defined in the same statement as other variables of the same type. For instance:
```c++
int myValue, *pint = &myValue;
```
In this case, `myValue` defines a pointer, `pint`, which is initialized with the address of `myValue`.

```c++
double readings[50], *marker = readings;
```
This works since `readings` defines an array, and `marker` defines a pointer, which is initialized with the address of the first element in the array.

```c++
int *pint = &myvalues;
int myValue;
```
This does not work because `pint` is being initialized with the address of an object that doesn't exist yet.
