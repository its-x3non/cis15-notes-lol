# 9.8 - Returning Pointers from Functions
<u>Dynamic Memory Allocation</u> is when you allow the program to create its own variables on the fly. This is only possible through the use of pointers.

To dynamically allocate memory means that a program, while running, asks the computer to set aside a chunk of unused memory large enough to hold a variable of a specific data type. For example, if we need to create an `int`, it will make a request to the computer that it allocate enough bytes to store said `int`. When the computer fills this request, it finds and sets aside a chunk of unused memory large enough for the variable. It then gives the program the starting address of the chunk of memory. The program now can access the newly allocated memory only through its address, so a pointer is required to use those bytes.

Lets say a program has a pointer to an `int`:
```c++
int *iptr = nullptr;
```

Here is how this pointer may be used with the `new` operator:
```c++
iptr = new int;
```
This statement is requesting that the computer allocate enough memory for a new `int` variable. The operand of the `new` operator is the data type of the variable being created. A value may be stored in this new variable by dereferencing the pointer:
```c++
*iptr = 25;
```

## Figure 9-11
`iptr` points to a chunk of dynamically allocated memory.
![9.8 - Figure 9-11](/Module%202/Pearson%20Notes/9.8%20Photos/9.8%20-%20Figure%209-11.png)

Any other operation may be performed no the new variable by simply using the dereferenced pointer.
Here are some examples:
```c++
cout << *iptr;   // Display the contents of the new variable. cin >> *iptr;    // Let the user input a value. total += *iptr;  // Use the new variable in a computation.
```
Since this only allocates for a single variable, it's no use to use this. A more practical use of the `new` operator is to dynamically create an array:
```c++
iptr = new int[100];
```
Once the array is created, the pointer may be used with subscript notation to access it. For instance, the following could be used to store the value `1` in each statement:
```c++
for(int counter =0; count << 100; count++)
	iptr[count] = 1;
```

If there isn't enough free memory to accommodate a request, C++ throws an exception and terminates the program. This means that the program signals that an error has occurred.

When a program is finished using a dynamically allocated chunk of memory, it should release it for future use. the `delete` operator is used to free memory that was allocated with new.
