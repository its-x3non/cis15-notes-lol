# 10.3 - C-Strings
**String** is a generic term that describes any consecutive sequence of characters. A word, a sentence, a person’s name, and the title of a song are all strings. In the C++ language, there are two primary ways that strings are stored in memory: as string objects or as C-strings. 

A **C-string** is a string whose characters are stored in consecutive memory locations and are followed by a null character, or null terminator. 
A null character or null terminator is a byte holds the ASCII code 0. Strings that are stored this way are called C-strings because this is the way strings are handled in the C programming language.

The purpose of the null terminator is to mark the end of the C-string. without it, there would be no way for a program to know the length of the C-string.

## More about String Literals
A string literal or string constant is enclosed in a set of double quotation marks (" ").
All of a program's string literals are stored in memory as C-strings, with the null terminator automatically appended.

### Program 10-4
```c++
// This program contains string literals.
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main()
{
    char again;
    do
    {
        cout << "C++ programming is great fun!" << endl;
        cout << "Do you want to see the message again? ";
        cin >> again;
        
    } while (again == 'Y' || again == 'y');
    return 0;
}

// =============== Output ===============
// "C++ programming is great fun!" 
// "Do you want to see the message again? "
// ======================================
```

The first string occupies 30 bytes of memory (including the null terminator), and the second string occupies 39 bytes.

When a string literal appears in a statement, it's actually its memory address that C++ uses.

## C-Strings Stored in Arrays
When a C programmer wants to store a string in memory, they have to create a `char` array that is large enough to hold the string, plus one extra element for the null character.
C-strings matter due to the fact that:
- The `string` class has not always existed in the C++ language. Several years ago, C++ stored strings as C-strings. As a professional programmer, you might encounter older C++ code (known as legacy code) that uses C-strings.
- Some of the C++ library functions work only with C-strings.
- In the workplace, it is not unusual for C++ programmers to work with specialized libraries that are written in C. Any strings with which C libraries work will be C-strings.

If you want to store a C-string in memory, you have to define a `char` array that is large enough to hold the string, plus one extra element for the null character:
```c++
const int SIZE = (num);
char name[SIZE];
```
This code defines a `char` array that has 21 elements, so it is big enough to hold a C-string that is no more than 20 characters long.

If the user enters a string of 30 characters, `cin` will write past the end of the array. This can be prevented using `cin's getline` member function.
```c++
const int SIZE = 80;
char line[SIZE];
```
The following statement `cin`'s getline member function to get a line of input (including whitespace):
```c++
cin.getline(line,SIZE);
```
The first argument tells getline where to store the string input. This statement indicates the starting address of the `line` array as the storage location for the string. The second argument indicates the maximum length of the string, including the null terminator.

### Program 10-5: String stored in an Array
```c++
// This program displays a string stored in a char array.
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
    const int SIZE = 80;   // Array size
    char line[SIZE];       // To hold a line of input
    int count = 0;         // Loop counter variable

    // Get a line of input.
    cout << "Enter a sentence of no more than "
         << (SIZE − 1) << " characters:\n";
    cin.getline(line, SIZE);

    // Display the input one character at a time.
    cout << "The sentence you entered is:\n";
    while (line[count] != '\0')
    {
        cout << line[count];
        count++;
    }
    return 0;
}

// =================== Output ===================
// Enter a sentence of no more than 79 characters:
// C++ is a powerful programming language! [Enter]
// The sentence you entered is:
// C++ is a powerful programming language!
// ==============================================
