# 11.10 - Pointers to Structures
Defining a variable that is a pointer to a structure is as simple as defining any other pointer variable: The date type is follower by an asterisk and the name of the pointer variable.
```c++
Circle *cirPtr = nullptr;
```

This statement defines `cirPtr` as a pointer to a `Circle` structure.
```c++
Circle myCircle = { 10.0, 20.0, 314.159 };
Circle *cirPtr = nullPtr;
cirPtr = &myCircle;
```

The first two lines define `myCircle`, a structure variable, and `cirPtr`, a pointer. The third line assigns the address of `myCircle` to `cirPtr`. After this line executes, `cirPtr` will point to the `myCircle` structure. This is illustrated in [Figure 11-4](#Figure%2011-4).
