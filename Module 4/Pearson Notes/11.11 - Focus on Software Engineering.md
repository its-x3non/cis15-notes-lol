# 11.11 - Focus on Software Engineering: When to Use `.`, When to Use `->`, When to Use `*`
Sometimes structures contain pointers as members. For example, the following structure declaration has an `int` pointer member:
```c++
struct GradeInfo
{
	string name;           // Student names
	int *testScores;       // Dynamically allocated array
	float average;         // Test average
};
```

It is important to remember that the structure pointer operator (`−>`) is used to dereference a pointer to a structure, not a pointer that is a member of a structure. If a program dereferences the `testScores` pointer in this structure, the indirection operator must be used. For example, assume that the following variable has been defined:
```c++
GradeInfo student1;
```

The following statement will display the value pointer to by the `testScores` member:
```c++
cout << *student1.testScores;
```

It is still possible to define a pointer to a structure that contains a pointer member. For instance, the following statement defines `stPtr` as a pointer to a `GradeInfo` structure:
```c++
GradeInfo *stPtr = nullptr;
```

Assuming `stPtr` points to a valid `GradeInfo` variable, the following statement will display the value pointed to by its `testScores` member:
```c++
cout << *stPtr−>testScores;
```

In this statement, the `*` operator dereferences `stPtr−>testScores`, while the `−>` operator dereferences `stPtr`. It might help to remember that the following expression:
```c++
stPtr−>testScores
```
is equivalent to
```c++
(*stPtr).testScores
```

So, the expression
```c++
*stPtr−>testScores
```
is the same as
```c++
*(*stPtr).testScores
```

The awkwardness of this last expression shows the necessity of the `−>` operator. [Table 11-3](#Table-11-3) lists some expressions using the `*`, `−>`, and `.` operators and describes what each references.

## Table 11-3
Structure Pointer Expressions
| Expression | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| `s->m`     |`s` is a structure pointer and `m` is a member. This expression accesses the `m` member of the structure pointed to by `s`.             |
| `*a.p`     |`a` is a structure variable and `p`, a pointer, is a member. This expression dereferences the value pointed to by `p`.             |
| `(*s).m`   |`s` is a structure pointer and `m` is a member. The `*` operator dereferences `s`, causing the expression to access the `m` member of the structure pointed to by `s`. This expression is the same as `s−>m`.             |
| `*s->p`    |`s` is a structure pointer and `p`, a pointer, is a member of the structure pointed to by `s`. This expression accesses the value pointed to by `p`. (The `−>` operator dereferences `s` and the `*` operator dereferences `p`.)             |
| `*(*s).p`           |`s` is a structure pointer and `p`, a pointer, is a member of the structure pointed to by `s`. This expression accesses the value pointed to by `p.(*s)` dereferences s and the outermost `*` operator dereferences `p`. The expression `*s−>p` is equivalent.             |
