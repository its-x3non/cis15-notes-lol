# 11.2 - Structures
So far, we’ve written programs that keep data in individual variables. If we need to group items together, C++ allows you to create arrays. The limitation of arrays, however, is that all the elements must be of the same data type. Sometimes a relationship exists between items of different types. For example, a payroll system might keep the variables shown in Table 11-2. These variables hold data for a single employee.

### Table 11-2
Variables in a Payroll System
| Variable Definition | Data Held       |
| ------------------- | --------------- |
| `int empNumber;`    | Employee Number |
| `string name;`      | Employee's Name |
| `double hours;`     | Hours Worked    |
| `double payRate;`   | Hourly Pay Rate |
| `double grossPay`   | Gross Pay                |
All these variables listed are related because they can hold data about the same employee. Their definition statements do not make it clear that they belong together though. To create a relationship between variables, C++ allows us the ability to package them together into a structure.

The general format of a structure declaration:
```c++
structure tag
{
	variable declaration;
	// more declaration if needed
};
```

The **tag** is the name of the structure. It's used like a data type name. The variable declarations that appear inside the braces declare **members** of the structure.
Here is an example of a structure declaration that holds the payroll data from **Table 11-2**.
```c++
struct PayRoll 
{   
    int empNumber;     // Employee number   
    string name;       // Employee's name
    double hours;      // Hours worked
    double payRate;    // Hourly pay rate
    double grossPay;   // Gross pay 
};
```

**WARNING**: A Semicolon is required after the closing brace of the structure declaration.

**NOTE**: We begin the names of the structure tags with an uppercase letter. This usually differentiates these names from the names of the variables.

**NOTE:** The structure declaration shown contains 3 `double` members, each declared on a separate line. The 3 could also be declared like this:
```c++
struct PayRoll
{
	int empNumber;
	string name;
	double hours, payRate, grossPay;
}
```

The structure declaration does not define a variable. It simply tells the compiler what a `PayRoll` structure is made of. It essentially creates a new data type named `PayRoll`. You can define variables of this type with simple definition statements, just as you would with any other data type. For example:
```c++
PayRoll deptHead;
```

The data type of `deptHead` is the `PayRoll` structure. The structure tag, `PayRoll`, is listed before the variable name, just as the word `int` or `double` would be listed to define variables of those types.
Since `deptHead` is a `PayRoll` structure, it contains the following:
```c++
empNumber, an int name, 
a string object hours, a double 
payRate, a double 
grossPay, a double
```

Just as it's possible to define multiple `int` or `double` variables, it's possible to define multiple structure variables in a program.
```c++
PayRoll deptHead, foreman, associate;
```

Each of the variables defined in this example is a separate **instance** of the `PayRoll` structure and contains its own members. An instance of a structure is a variable that exists in memory. It contains within it all the members described in the structure declaration.

Although the structure variables (in the example) are separate, each contains members with the same name. Here are some examples of structure declaration and variable definitions:

### Struct Time
```c++
struct Time
{
	int hour;
	int minutes;
	int seconds;
};
// Definition of the
// structure variable now.
Time now;
```

### Struct Date
```c++
structure Date
{
	int day;
	int month;
	int year;
};
// Definition of the structure
// variable today.
Date today;
```

There are typically 2 steps into implementing structures in a program:
- Create the structure declaration. This establishes the tag (or name) of the structure and a list of items that are members.
- Define variables (or instances) of the structure and use them in the program to hold data.
