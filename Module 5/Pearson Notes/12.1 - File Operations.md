#Module5 #PearsonNotes 
# 12.1 - File Operations
We learned how to write programs that perform simple file operations back in Chapter 5. This chapter covers more advanced file operations and focuses primarily on the `fstream` data type.

### Table 12-1
This table compares `ifstream`, `ofstream`, and `fstream` data types. All of these data types requires the `#include<fstream>` header file.
| Data Type  | Description                                                                             |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ifstream` | Input File Stream. This data type can be used only to read data from files into memory. |
| `ofstream` | Output File Stream. This data type can be used to create files and write data to them.  |
| `fstream`  | File Stream. This data type can be used to create files, write data to them, and read data from them.                                                                                        |

## Using the `fstream` Data Type
We can define an `fstream` object just as we define objects of other data types:
```c++
fstream dataFile
```

An `fstream` object's open function requires 2 arguments. The first argument is a string containing the name of the file. The 2nd argument is a file access flag that indicates the mode in which you wish to open the file.
```c++
dataFile.open("info.txt", ios::out);
```

The first argument in this function call is the name of the file, info.txt. The second argument is the file access flag `ios::out`. This tells C++ to open the file in output mode. Output mode allows data to be written to a file. The following statement uses the `ios::in` access flag to open a file in input mode, which allows data to be read from the file.
```c++
dataFile.open("info.txt", ios::in);
```

### Table 12-2
File Access Flags
| File Access Flag | Meaning |
| ---------------- | ------- |
| `ios::app`          |Append mode. If the file already exists, its contents are preserved and all output is written to the end of the file. By default, this flag causes the file to be created if it does not exist.         |
| `ios::ate`         | If the file already exists, the program goes directly to the end of it. Output may be written anywhere in the file.        |
| `ios::binary`      | Binary mode. When a file is opened in binary mode, data are written to or read from it in pure binary format. (The default mode is text.)        |
| `ios::in`          | Input mode. Data will be read from the file. If the file does not exist, it will not be created, and the open function will fail.        |
| `ios::out`         | Output mode. Data will be written to the file. By default, the file’s contents will be deleted if it already exists.        |
| `ios::trunc`                 | If the file already exists, its contents will be deleted (truncated). This is the default mode used by ios::out﻿.        |

You can use multiple flags together using the `|` operator. The following statement opens the file info.txt in both input and output modes:
```c++
dataFile.open("info.txt", ios::in | ios::out);
```

***
**NOTE:** When used by itself, the `ios::out` flag causes the file’s contents to be deleted if the file already exists. When used with the `ios::in` flag, however, the file’s existing contents are preserved. If the file does not already exist, it will be created.
***

```c++
dataFile.open("info.txt", ios::out | ios:app);
```
This statement opens the file in such a way that data will only be written to its end.

By using different combinations of access flags, you can open files in many possible modes.

### Program 12-1
Uses an `fstream` object to open a file for output, then writes data to the file.
```c++
  // This program uses an fstream object to write data to a file.
  #include <iostream>
  #include <fstream>
  using namespace std;

  int main()
  {
      fstream dataFile;
      
      cout << "Opening file...\n";
      dataFile.open("demofile.txt", ios::out); // Open for output
      cout << "Now writing data to the file.\n";
      dataFile << "Jones\n"; // Write line 1
      dataFile << "Smith\n"; // Write line 2
      dataFile << "Willis\n"; // Write line 3
      dataFile << "Davis\n"; // Write line 4
      dataFile.close(); // Close the file
      cout << "Done.\n";
      return 0;
 }
 
// ============ Output ============
// Opening file...
// Now writing data to the file.
// Done.
// ================================

// === Output in demofile.txt ===
// Jones
// Smith
// Willis
// Davis
// ===============================

```

The actual file contents appears as is in [Figure 12-1](#Figure-12-1)

### Figure 12-1
File Contents
| J   | o   | n   | e    | s   | `\n` | S   | m   | i   | t    | h   | `\n` | W   | i   | l   |
| --- | --- | --- | ---- | --- | ---- | --- | --- | --- | ---- | --- | ---- | --- | --- | --- |
| l   | i   | s   | `\n` | D   | a    | v   | i   | s   | `\n` | `<EOF>`    |      |     |     |     |

The characters are added to the file sequentially, in the order they are written by the program. The very last character is an **end-of-file marker**. It is a character that marks the end of the file, and is automatically written when the file is closed.
The actual character that is used to mark the end of a file actually depends on the OS being used. It's always a nonprinting character.

### Program 12-2
This program is a modified version of [Program 12-1](#Program-12-1). 
The file is opened, two names are written to it, and it is closed. The file is then reopened by the program in append mode (with the `ios::app` access flag). When a file is opened in append mode, its contents are preserved, and all subsequent output is appended to the file’s end. Two more names are added to the file before it is closed and the program terminates.
```c++
  // This program writes data to a file, closes the file,
  // then reopens the file and appends more data.
  #include <iostream>
  #include <fstream>
  using namespace std;

  int main()
  {
      ofstream dataFile;
      
      cout << "Opening file...\n";
      // Open the file in output mode.
      dataFile.open("demofile.txt", ios::out);
      cout << "Now writing data to the file.\n";
      dataFile << "Jones\n";             // Write line 1
      dataFile << "Smith\n";             // Write line 2
      cout << "Now closing the file.\n";
      dataFile.close();                  // Close the file

      cout << "Opening the file again...\n";
      // Open the file in append mode.
      dataFile.open("demofile.txt", ios::out | ios::app);
      cout << "Writing more data to the file.\n";
      dataFile << "Willis\n";            // Write line 3
      dataFile << "Davis\n";             // Write line 4
      cout << "Now closing the file.\n"; // Close the file
      dataFile.close();

      cout << "Done.\n";
      return 0;
 }

// === Output in demofile.txt ===
// Jones
// Smith
// Willis
// Davis
// ===============================
```

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---- | ------- |

The file is closed, and an end of file character is automatically written. when the file is reopened, the new output is appended to the end of the file. as shown in [Figure 12-3](#Figure-12-3)

### Figure 12-3
| J   | o   | n   | e    | s   | `\n` | S   | m   | i   | t    | h   | `\n` | W   | i   | l   |
| --- | --- | --- | ---- | --- | ---- | --- | --- | --- | ---- | --- | ---- | --- | --- | --- |
| l   | i   | s   | `\n` | D   | a    | v   | i   | s   | `\n` | `<EOF>`    |      |     |     |     |

***
**NOTE:** If the `ios::out` flag had been alone, without `ios::app` the second time the file was opened, the file’s contents would have been deleted. If this had been the case, the names Jones and Smith would have been erased, and the file would only have contained the names Willis and Davis.
***
## File Open Modes with `ifstream` and `ofstream` Objects
The `ifstream` and `ofstream` data types each have a default mode in which they open files. This mode determines the operations that may be performed on the file and what happens if the file that is being opened already exists.
### Table 12-3
Default Open Mode
| File Type  | Default Open Mode |
| ---------- | ----------------- |
| `ofstream` |The file is opened for output only. Data may be written to the file, but not read from the file. If the file does not exist, it is created. If the file already exists, its contents are deleted (the file is truncated).                   |
| `ifstream`           | The file is opened for input only. Data may be read from the file, but not written to it. The file’s contents will be read from its beginning. If the file does not exist, the open function fails.                   |

You cannot change the fact that `ifstream` files may only be read from, and `ofstream`﻿ files may only be written to. We can vary the way operations are carried out on these files by providing a file access flag as an optional second argument to the open function, however.
```c++
ofstream outputFile;
outputFile.open("values.txt", ios::out | ios::app);
```
The code that is currently shown shows an example using an `ofstream` object.
The `ios::app` flag specifies that data written to the values.txt file should be appended to its existing contents.

## Checking for a File's Existence Before Opening It
Sometimes you want to determine whether a file already exists before opening it for output. We can do this by first attempting to open the file for input. If the file does not exist, the open operation will fail. In that case, you can create the file by opening it for output:
```c++
fstream dataFile;
dataFile.open("values.txt", ios::in);
if (dataFile.fail())
{
	// The file does not exist, so create it.
	dataFile.open("values.txt", ios::out);
	//
	// Continue to process the file . . .
	//
	}
	else    // The file already exists.
	{
	dataFile.close();
	cout << "The file values.txt already exists.\n";
}
```
## Opening a file with the File Stream Object Definition Statement
An alternate way to using the `open` member function is to use the file stream object definition statement to open the file.
```c++
fstream dataFile("names.txt", ios::in | ios::out);
```

This statement defines an `fstream` object named `dataFile` and uses it to open the file names.txt. The file is opened in both input and output modes. This technique eliminates the need to call the `open` function when your program knows the name and access mode of the file at the time the object is defined. You may also use this technique with `ifstream` and `ofstream` objects:
```c++
ifstream inputFile("info.txt"); ofstream outputFile("addresses.txt"); ofstream dataFile("customers.txt", ios::out | ios::app);
```

You may also test for errors after you have opened a file with this technique:
```c++
ifstream inputFile("SalesData.txt");
if (!inputFile)
	cout << "Error opening SalesData.txt.\n";
```
