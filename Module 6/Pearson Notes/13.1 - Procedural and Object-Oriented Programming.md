# 13.1 - Procedural and Object-Oriented Programming
**CONCEPT:** Procedural programming is a method of writing software. It is a programming practice centered on the procedures or actions that take place in a program. Object-oriented programming is centered around the object. Objects are created from abstract data types that encapsulate data and functions together.
There are 2 common programming methods in practice today: procedural programming and object-oriented programming (OOP).

Procedural programming has worked well for years, but as programs get more large and more complex, the separation of a program's data and the code that operates on the data can lead to problems. Quite often, a program's specifications change, resulting in redesigned data structures. When the structure of the data changes, the code that operates on the data must also change to accept the new format. This results in the additional work for programmers and a greater opportunity for bugs to appear in the code.
This problem has helped influence the shift from procedural programming to object-oriented programming (OOP). Object-oriented programming is centered on creating objects. An **object** is a software entity that contains both data and procedures. The data contained in an object are known as object's **attributes**. The procedures an object performs are called **member functions**. The object is, conceptually, a self-contained unit consisting of attributes (data) and procedures (functions).

**NOTE:** In other programming languages, the procedures an object performs are often called *methods*.
***

OOP addresses the problem that can result from the separation of code and data through **encapsulation**, the combining code of data and code into a single object, and **data hiding**, an object's ability to hide its data from code that is outside the object. Only the object's member functions may directly access and make changes to the object's data. An object typically hides it data, but allows outside code to access its member functions.

### Figure 13-2
In this figure, the object's member functions provide programming statements outside the object with indirect access to the object's data. <br />
![Figure 13-2](13.1%20Photos/13.1%20-%20Figure%2013-2.png)
<br />
When an object’s internal data are hidden from outside code, and access to that data is restricted to the object’s member functions, the data are protected from accidental corruption. In addition, the programming code outside the object does not need to know about the format or internal structure of the object’s data. The code only needs to interact with the object’s functions. When a programmer changes the structure of an object’s internal data, he or she also modifies the object’s member functions so they may properly operate on the data. The way in which outside code interacts with the member functions, however, does not change.
These are also valid concerns in software development. A real-world program is rarely written by only one person. Even the programs you have created so far weren’t written entirely by you. If you incorporated C++ library functions, or objects like `cin` and `cout`, you used code written by someone else. In the world of professional software development, programmers commonly work in teams, buy and sell their code, and collaborate on projects. With OOP, programmers can create objects with powerful engines tucked away “under the hood,” protected by simple interfaces that safeguard the object’s algorithms.

## Object Reusability
In addition to solving the problems of code/data separation, the use of OOP has also been encouraged by the trend of **object reusability**. An object is not a stand-alone program, but is used by programs that need its service.
For example, Sharon is a programmer who has developed an object for rendering 3D images. She is a math whiz and knows a lot about computer graphics, so her object is coded to perform all the necessary 3D mathematical operations and handle the computer’s video hardware. Tom, who is writing a program for an architectural firm, needs his application to display 3D images of buildings. Because he is working under a tight deadline and does not possess a great deal of knowledge about computer graphics, he can use Sharon’s object to perform the 3D rendering (for a small fee, of course!).

# Classes and Objects
A **class** is code that specifies the attributes and member functions that a particular type of object may have. A class is not an object, but it is a description of an object. When the program is running, it uses the class to create, in memory, as many objects of a specific type as needed. Each object that is created from a class is called an **instance** of the class.

For example, Jessica is an entomologist (someone who studies insects), and she also enjoys writing computer programs. She designs a program to catalog different types of insects. As part of the program, she creates a class named `Insect`, which specifies attributes and member functions for holding and manipulating data common to all types of insects. The `Insect` class is not an object, but a specification that objects may be created from. Next, she writes programming statements that create a housefly object, which is an instance of the `Insect` class. The `housefly` object is an entity that occupies computer memory and stores data about a housefly. It has the attributes and member functions specified by the `Insect` class. Then she writes programming statements that create a mosquito object. The `mosquito` object is also an instance of the `Insect` class. It has its own area in memory and stores data about a mosquito. Although the `housefly` and `mosquito` objects are two separate entities in the computer’s memory, they were both created from the `Insect` class. This means that each of the objects has the attributes and member functions described by the Insect class. This is illustrated in [Figure 13-4](#Figure-13-4).

## Figure 13-4

At the beginning of this section, we discussed how a procedural program that works with rectangles might have variables to hold the rectangle’s width and length and separate functions to do things like store values in the variables and make calculations. The program would pass the variables to the functions as needed. In an object-oriented program, we would create a Rectangle class, which would encapsulate the data (width and length) and the functions that work with the data. [Figure 13-5](#Figure-13-5) shows a representation of such a class.

## Figure 13-5

<br />
In the object-oriented approach, the variables and functions are all members of the `Rectangle` class. When we need to work with a rectangle in our program, we create a `Rectangle` object, which is an instance of the `Rectangle` class. When we need to perform an operation on the `Rectangle` object’s data, we use that object to call the appropriate member function. For example, if we need to get the area of the rectangle, we use the object to call the `getArea` member function. The `getArea` member function would be designed to calculate the area of that object’s rectangle and return the value.

# Using a Class You Already Know
You must have `#include <string>` in any program that uses any `string` class. You can next define a `string` object with a statement like `string cityName;`. Which `string` creates object `cityName`. The `cityName` object is an instance of the `string` class.
Once a `string` object has been created, you can store data in it. Because the `string` class is designed to work with the assignment operator, you can assign a string literal to a `string` object. For example: `cityName = "Charleston";` After this statement executes, the string `"Charleston"` will be stored in the `cityName` object. `"Charleston"` will become the object's data.

The `string` class specifies numerous member functions that perform operations on the data that a `string` object holds. For example, it has a member function named length, which returns the length of the string stored in a `string` object.
```c++
string cityName;              // Create a string object named cityName
int strSize;                  // To hold the length of a string
cityName = "Charleston";      // Assign "Charleston" to cityName
strSize = cityName.length();  // Store the string length in strSize
```
The last statement calls the `length` member function, which returns the length of a string. The expression `cityName.length()` returns the length of the string stored in the `cityName` object. After this statement executes, the `strSize` variable will contain the value 10, which is the length of the string `"Charleston"`.

The `string` class also specifies a member function named append, which appends an additional string onto the string already stored in an object. The following code demonstrates this:
```c++
string cityName;
cityName = "Charleston";
cityName.append(" South Caroline");
```
In the second line, the string `"Charleston"` is assigned to the `cityName` object. In the third line, the append member function is called and `" South Carolina"` is passed as an argument. The argument is appended to the string that is already stored in `cityName`. After this statement executes, the `cityName` object will contain the string `"Charleston South Carolina"`.
