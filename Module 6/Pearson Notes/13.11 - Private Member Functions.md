# 13.11 - Private Member Functions
Sometimes a class will contain one or more member functions that are necessary for internal processing, but should not be called by code outside the class. For example, a class might have a member function that performs a calculation only when a value is stored in a particular member variable and should not be performed at any other time. That function should not be directly accessible by code outside the class because it might get called at the wrong time. In this case, the member function should be declared `private`. When a member function is declared `private`, it may only be called internally.

#### Contents of `ContactInfo.h` (v2)
```c++
// Contact class specification file (version 2) 
#ifndef CONTACTINFO_H 
#define CONTACTINFO_H 
#include <cstring>    // Needed for strlen and strcpy 
 
// ContactInfo class declaration. 
class ContactInfo 
{ 
private: 
   char *name;   // The contact's name 
   char *phone;  // The contact's phone number 
 
   // Private member function: initName 
   // This function initializes the name attribute. 
   void initName(char *n) 
   { name = new char[strlen(n) + 1]; 
     strcpy(name, n); } 
 
   // Private member function: initPhone 
   // This function initializes the phone attribute. 
   void initPhone(char *p) 
   { phone = new char[strlen(p) + 1]; 
     strcpy(phone, p); } 
public: 
   // Constructor 
   ContactInfo(char *n, char *p) 
   { // Initialize the name attribute. 
     initName(n); 
 
     // Initialize the phone attribute. 
     initPhone(n); } 
 
   // Destructor 
   ~ContactInfo() 
   { delete [] name; 
     delete [] phone; } 
 
   const char *getName() const 
   { return name; } 
 
   const char *getPhoneNumber() const 
   { return phone; } 
}; 
#endif 
```
In this version of the class, the logic in the constructor is modularized. It calls two private member functions: `initName` and `initPhone`. The `initName` function allocates memory for the name attribute and initializes it with the value pointed to by the `n` parameter. The `initPhone` function allocates memory for the phone attribute and initializes it with the value pointed to by the `p` parameter. These functions are private because they should be called only from the constructor. If they were ever called by code outside the class, they would change the values of the `name` and `phone` pointers without deallocating the memory that they currently point to.
