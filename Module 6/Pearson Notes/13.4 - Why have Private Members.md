# 13.4 - Why Have Private Members
As mentioned earlier before in this chapter, classes have variables and functions that are meant to be used internally, not by external statements. When a member variable is declared as private, the only way for an application to store values in the variable is through a public member function. Public members become an interface to the object and are the only members that can be accessed by any application that uses the object.

## Figure 13-13
Private member variables may be accessed only by member functions <br />

In the `Rectangle` class, the width and length member variables hold critical data. Therefore they are declared as private, and an interface is constructed with public member functions. If a program creates a Rectangle object, the program must use the `setWidth` and `getWidth` member functions to access the object’s width member. To access the object’s length member, the program must use the `setLength` and `getLength` member functions. This idea is illustrated in the diagram above.

The public member functions can be written to filter out invalid data. For example, look at the following version of the `setWidth` member function:
```c++
void Rectangle::setWidth(double w)
{
	if (w >= 0)
		width = w;
	else
	{
		cout << "Invalid width\n";
		exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
	}
}
```
Notice this version of the function doesn’t just assign the parameter value to the width variable. It first tests the parameter to make sure it is 0 or greater. If a negative number was passed to the function, an error message is displayed, then the standard library function `exit` is called to abort the program. The `setLength` function could be written in a similar way:
```c++
void Rectangle::setLength(double len)
{
	if (w >= 0)
		width = len;
	else
	{
		cout << "Invalid length\n";
		exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
	}
}
```

Mutator functions can store values in attributes and validate them to ensure only acceptable data is stored in the object's attributes. However, calling the `exit` function is not the best way to deal with invalid data, as invalid data is not used to abort the entire program. In [Chapter 15], exceptions are discussed to provide a better way for classes to handle errors, but only rudimentary data validation techniques are used.
