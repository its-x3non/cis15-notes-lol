# 13.5 - Focus on Software Engineering: Separating Class Specification from Implementation
In the programs we’ve looked at so far, the class declaration, member function definitions, and application program are all stored in one file. A more conventional way of designing C++ programs is to store class declarations and member function definitions in their own separate files. Typically, program components are stored in the following fashion:
- Class declarations are stored in their own header files. A header file that contains a class declaration is called a class specification file. The name of the **class specification file** is usually the same as the name of the class, with a `.h` extension. For example, the Rectangle class would be declared in the file `Rectangle.h`.
- The member function definitions for a class are stored in a separate .cpp file called the **class implementation file**. The file usually has the same name as the class, with the .cpp extension. For example, the `Rectangle` class’s member functions would be defined in the file Rectangle.cpp.
- Any program that uses the class should `#include` the class’s header file. The class’s .cpp file (which contains the member function definitions) should be compiled and linked with the main program. This process can be automated with a project or make utility. Integrated development environments such as Visual Studio also provide the means to create the multi-file projects.

#### Contents of `Rectangle.h` (V1)
```c++
// Specification file for the Rectangle class.
#ifndef RECTANGLE_H
#define RECTANGLE_H

// Rectangle class declaration.
class Rectangle
{
    private:
       double width;
       double length;
   public:
       void setWidth(double);
       void setLength(double);
       double getWidth() const;
       double getLength() const;
       double getArea() const;
};

#endif
```
This is the specification file for the `Rectangle` class. It contains only the declaration of the `Rectangle` class. It does not contain any member function definitions.
When we write other programs that use the `Rectangle` class, we can have an `#include` directive that includes this file. That way, we don't have to write the class declaration in every program that uses the `Rectangle` class.

This file also introduces 2 new preprocessor directives: `#ifndef` and `#endif`.

### Figure 13-14
How an include guard works. <br />
![Figure 13-14](13.5%20Photos/13.5%20-%20Figure%2013-14.png) <br />
The `#ifndef` directive is called an **include guard.** It prevents the header file from accidentally being included more than once. When your main program has an `#include` directive for a header file, there is always the possibility that the header file will have an `#include` directive for a second header file. If your program file also has an `#include` directive for the second header file, then the preprocessor will include the second header file twice. Unless an include guard has been written into the second header file, an error will occur because the compiler will process the declarations in the second header file twice.
The word `ifndef` stands for "`if` `n`ot `def`ined." It is used to determine whether a specific constant has not been defined with a `#define` directive.
In the `Rectangle.h` file, when the file is being compiled, the `#ifndef` directive checks for the existence of a constant named `RECTANGLE_H` . If the constant has not been defined, it's immediately define in line 3, and the rest of the file is included. If the constant has been defined, it means the file has already been included. In that case, everything between `#ifndef` and `#endif` directives is skipped.

#### Contents of `Rectangle.cpp` (V1)
```c++
// Implementation file for the Rectangle class.
#include "Rectangle.h"     // Needed for the Rectangle class
#include <iostream>        // Needed for cout
#include <cstdlib>         // Needed for the exit function
using namespace std;

//***********************************************************
// setWidth sets the value of the member variable width.    *
//***********************************************************

void Rectangle::setWidth(double w)
{
    if (w >= 0)
        width = w;
    else
    {
        cout << "Invalid width\n";
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }
}

//***********************************************************
// setLength sets the value of the member variable length.  *
//***********************************************************

void Rectangle::setLength(double len)
{
    if (len >= 0)
        length = len;
    else
    {
        cout << "Invalid length\n";
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }
}

//************************************************************
// getWidth returns the value in the member variable width.  *
//************************************************************

double Rectangle::getWidth() const
{
    return width;
}

//**************************************************************
// getLength returns the value in the member variable length.  *
//**************************************************************

double Rectangle::getLength() const
{
    return length;
}

//************************************************************
// getArea returns the product of width times length.        *
//************************************************************

double Rectangle::getArea() const
{
    return width * length;
}
```

Take a look at this line:
```c++
#include "Rectangle.h"
```
This is located in line 2. <br />
This directive includes the `Rectangle.h` file, which contains the `Rectangle` class declaration. Notice the name of the header file is enclosed in double-quote characters `(" ")` instead of angled brackets `(<>)`. When you are including a C++ system header file, such as iostream, you enclose the name of the file in angled brackets. This indicates the file is located in the compiler’s include file directory. The include file directory is the directory or folder where all of the standard C++ header files are located. When you are including a header file that you have written, such as a class specification file, you enclose the name of the file in double-quote marks. This indicates the file is located in the current project directory.
Any file that uses the `Rectangle` class must have an `#include` directive for the `Rectangle.h `file. We need to include `Rectangle.h` in the class specification file because the functions in this file belong to the `Rectangle` class. Before the compiler can process a function with `Rectangle::` in its name, it must have already processed the `Rectangle` class declaration.

## Program 13-5
This program shows a modified version of [Program 13-1](13.3%20-%20Defining%20an%20Instance%20of%20a%20Class.md#Program-13-1). This program is redesigned to be compiled and linked with the specification and implementation files.
```c++
// This program uses the Rectangle class, which is declared in
// the Rectangle.h file. The member Rectangle class's member
// functions are defined in the Rectangle.cpp file. This program
// should be compiled with those files in a project.
#include <iostream>
#include "Rectangle.h" // Needed for Rectangle class
using namespace std;

int main()
{
   Rectangle box;     // Define an instance of the Rectangle class
   double rectWidth;  // Local variable for width
   double rectLength; // Local variable for length

   // Get the rectangle's width and length from the user.
   cout << "This program will calculate the area of a\n";
   cout << "rectangle. What is the width? ";
   cin >> rectWidth;
   cout << "What is the length? ";
   cin >> rectLength;

   // Store the width and length of the rectangle
   // in the box object.
   box.setWidth(rectWidth);
   box.setLength(rectLength);

   // Display the rectangle's data.
   cout << "Here is the rectangle's data:\n";
   cout << "Width: " << box.getWidth() << endl;
   cout << "Length: " << box.getLength() << endl;
   cout << "Area: " << box.getArea() << endl;
   return 0;
}
```
Notice Program 13-5 has an `#include` directive for the` Rectangle.h` file in line 6. This causes the declaration for the `Rectangle` class to be included in the file. 

To create an executable program from this file, the following steps must be taken:
### Figure 13-15
Creating an executable file. <br />
![Figure 13-5](13.5%20Photos/13.5%20-%20Figure%2013-15.png) <br />
- The implementation file, `Rectangle.cpp`, must be compiled. `Rectangle.cpp` is not a complete program, so you cannot create an executable file from it alone. Instead, you compile `Rectangle.cpp` to an object file that contains the compiled code for the `Rectangle` class. This file would typically be named `Rectangle.obj`.
- The main program file, `Pr13–4.cpp`, must be compiled. This file is not a complete program either because it does not contain any of the implementation code for the `Rectangle` class. So, you compile this file to an object file such as `Pr13–4.obj`.
- The object files, `Pr13–4.obj` and `Rectangle.obj`, are linked together to create an executable file, which would be named something like `Pr13–4.exe`.

##### More About Creating Executable Files
The exact details on how these steps take place are different for each C++ development system. Fortunately, most systems perform all of these steps automatically for you. For example, in Microsoft Visual Studio you create a project, then you simply add all of the files to the project. When you compile the project, the steps are taken care of for you and an executable file is generated.
Separating a class into a specification file and an implementation file provides a great deal of flexibility when giving it to another programmer. The other programmer simply inserts the necessary `#include` directive into their program, compiles it, and links it with the class's object file. This prevents the other programmer from making changes that could introduce bugs.
Separating a class into specification and implementation files also makes things easier when the class’s member functions must be modified. It is only necessary to modify the implementation file and recompile it to a new object file. Programs that use the class don’t have to be completely recompiled, just linked with the new object file.
