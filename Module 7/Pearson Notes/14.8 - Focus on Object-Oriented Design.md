# 14.8 - Focus on Object-Oriented Design: Class Collaborations
In an object-oriented application, it is common for objects of different classes to **collaborate**. This simply means objects interact with each other. Sometimes one object will need the services of another object in order to fulfill its responsibilities. For example, let’s say an object needs to read a number from the keyboard then format the number to appear as a dollar amount. The object might use the services of the `cin` object to read the number from the keyboard then use the services of another object that is designed to format the number.

If one object is to collaborate with another object, then it must know something about the other object’s member functions and how to call them. Let’s look at an example.

The following code shows a class named `Stock`. An object of this class holds data about a company’s stock. This class has two attributes: `symbol` and `sharePrice`. The `symbol` attribute holds the trading symbol for the company’s stock. This is a short series of characters that are used to identify the stock on the stock exchange. For example, the XYZ Company’s stock might have the trading symbol XYZ. The `sharePrice` attribute holds the current price per share of the stock. The class also has the following member functions:
- A default constructor that initializes `symbol` to an empty string and `sharePrice` to 0.0.
- A constructor that accepts arguments for the symbol and share price.
- `set` — a function that accepts arguments for the symbol and share price
- `getSymbol` — a function that returns the stock’s trading symbol
- `getSharePrice` — a function that returns the current price of the stock

#### Contents of `Stock.h`
```c++
 #ifndef STOCK
 #define STOCK
 #include <string>
 using namespace std;

 class Stock
 {
 private:
    string symbol;        // Trading symbol of the stock
    double sharePrice;    // Current price per share
 public:
    // Default constructor
    Stock()
        { set("", 0.0);}

    // Constructor
    Stock(const string sym, double price)
        { set(sym, price); }

    // Copy constructor
    Stock(const Stock &obj)
        { set(obj.symbol, obj.sharePrice); }

    // Mutator function
    void set(string sym, double price)
         { symbol = sym;
           sharePrice = price; }

    // Accessor functions
    string getSymbol() const
         { return symbol; }

    double getSharePrice() const
         { return sharePrice; }
 };
 #endif
```

The following code shows another class named `StockPurchase` that uses an object of the `Stock` class to simulate the purchase of a stock. The `StockPurchase` class is responsible for calculating the cost of the stock purchase. To do that, the `StockPurchase` class must know how to call the `Stock` class’s `getSharePrice` function to get the price per share of the stock.

#### Contents of `StockPurchase.h`
```c++
 #ifndef STOCK_PURCHASE
 #define STOCK_PURCHASE
 #include "Stock.h"

 class StockPurchase
 {
 private:
     Stock stock;   // The stock that was purchased
     int shares;    // The number of shares
 public:
     // The default constructor sets shares to 0. The stock
     // object is initialized by its default constructor.
     StockPurchase()
         { shares = 0;}

     // Constructor
     StockPurchase(const Stock &stockObject, int numShares)
         { stock = stockObject;
           shares = numShares; }

     // Accessor function
     double getCost() const
         { return shares * stock.getSharePrice(); }
 };
 #endif
```
The second constructor for the `StockPurchase` class accepts a Stock object representing the stock that is being purchased, and an `int` representing the number of shares to purchase. In line 18, we see the first collaboration: the `StockPurchase` constructor makes a copy of the `Stock` object by using the `Stock` class’s copy constructor. The next collaboration takes place in the `getCost` function. This function calculates and returns the cost of the stock purchase. In line 23, it calls the `Stock` class’s `getSharePrice` function to determine the stock’s price per share. 

## Program 14-16
Demonstrates the `Stock` class
```c++
 // Stock trader program
 #include <iostream>
 #include <iomanip>
 #include "Stock.h"
 #include "StockPurchase.h"
 using namespace std;

 int main()
 {
    int sharesToBuy; // Number of shares to buy
    
    // Create a Stock object for the company stock. The
    // trading symbol is XYZ and the stock is currently
    // priced at $9.62 per share.
    Stock xyzCompany("XYZ", 9.62);

    // Display the symbol and current share price.
    cout << setprecision(2) << fixed << showpoint;
    cout << "XYZ Company's trading symbol is "
         << xyzCompany.getSymbol() << endl;
    cout << "The stock is currently $"
         << xyzCompany.getSharePrice()
         << " per share.\n";

    // Get the number of shares to purchase.
    cout << "How many shares do you want to buy? ";
    cin >> sharesToBuy;

    // Create a StockPurchase object for the transaction.
    StockPurchase buy(xyzCompany, sharesToBuy);

    // Display the cost of the transaction.
    cout << "The cost of the transaction is $"
         << buy.getCost() << endl;
    return 0;
 }

// =============== Output ===============
// XYZ Company's trading symbol is XYZ
// The stock is currently $9.62 per share.
// How many shares do you want to buy? 100 [Enter]
// The cost of the transaction is $962.00
// ======================================
```

# Determining Class Collaborations with CRC Cards
During the object-oriented design process, you can determine many of the collaborations that will be necessary between classes by examining the responsibilities of the classes. In Chapter 13, we discussed the process of finding the classes and their responsibilities. Recall from that section that a class’s responsibilities are:
- The things that the class is responsible for knowing.  
- The actions that the class is responsible for doing.

Often you will determine that the class must collaborate with another class in order to fulfill one or more of its responsibilities. One popular method of discovering a class’s responsibilities and collaborations is by creating CRC cards. *CRC* stands for class, responsibilities, and collaborations.

You can use simple index cards for this procedure. Once you have gone through the process of finding the classes, set aside one index card for each class. At the top of the index card, write the name of the class. Divide the rest of the card into two columns. In the left column, write each of the class’s responsibilities. As you write each responsibility, think about whether the class needs to collaborate with another class to fulfill that responsibility. Ask yourself questions such as:
- Will an object of this class need to get data from another object in order to fulfill this responsibility?  
- Will an object of this class need to request another object to perform an operation in order to fulfill this responsibility?

## Figure 14-8
CRC card <br />
![Figure 14-8](14.8%20Photos/14.8%20-%20Figure%2014-8.png) <br />
From the CRC card shown in the figure, we can see that the `StockPurchase` class has the following responsibilities and collaborations:
• Responsibility: To know the stock to purchase
   Collaboration: The `Stock` class
• Responsibility: To know the number of shares to purchase
   Collaboration: None
• Responsibility: To calculate the cost of the purchase
   Collaboration: The `Stock` class

When you have completed a CRC card for each class in the application, you will have a good idea of each class’s responsibilities and how the classes must interact.
