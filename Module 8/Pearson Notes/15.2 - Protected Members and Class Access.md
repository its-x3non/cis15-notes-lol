# 15.2 - Protected Members and Class Access

Protected members of a base class are like private members, except they may be accessed by functions in a derived class. To the rest of the program, however, protected members are inaccessible.

The following code shows a modified version of the `GradedActivity` class declaration. The private member of the class has been made protected.
