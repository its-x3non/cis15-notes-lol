# 13.15 - Focus on Object-Oriented Design: The Unified Modeling Language (UML)
When designing a class, it is often helpful to draw a UML diagram. UML stands for **Unified Modeling Language**. The UML provides a set of standard diagrams for graphically depicting object-oriented systems. 

## Figure 13-18

This shows the general layout of a UML diagram for a class. Notice the diagram is a box that is divided into three sections. The top section is where you write the name of the class. The middle section holds a list of the class’s member variables. The bottom section holds a list of the class’s member functions.

## Figure 13-19

Earlier in this chapter, you studied a `Rectangle` class that could be used in a program that works with rectangles. The first version of the `Rectangle` class that you studied had the following member variables:
- `width`
- `length`
The class also had the following member functions:
- `setWidth`
- `setLength`
- `getWidth`
- `getLength`
- `getArea`
From this information alone we can construct a simple UML diagram for the class, which is shown above.

The UML diagram tells us the name of the class, the names of the member variables, and the names of the member functions. The UML diagram in This figure does not convey many of the class details, however, such as access specification, member variable data types, parameter data types, and function return types. The UML provides optional notation for these types of details.

# Showing Access Specification in the UML Diagrams Test
The UML diagram in [Figure 13-19](#Figure-13-19) lists all of the members of the `Rectangle` class, but does not indicate which members are private and which are public. In a UML diagram, you may optionally place a `-` character before a member name to indicate that is is private, or a `+` character to indicate that it's public.

# Data Type and Parameter Notation in UML Diagrams
The Unified Modeling Language also provides notation that you may use to indicate the data types of member variables, member functions, and parameters. To indicate the data type of a member variable, place a colon followed by the name of the data type after the name of the variable. For example, the `width` variable in the `Rectangle` class is a double. It could be listed as follows in the UML diagram:
```c++
- width : double
```

***
**NOTE:** In UML notation the variable name is listed first, then the data type. This is the opposite of C++ syntax, which requires the data type to appear first.
***

The return type of a member function can be listed in the same manner: After the function’s name, place a colon followed by the return type. The `Rectangle` class’s `getLength` function returns a double, so it could be listed as follows in the UML diagram:
```c++
+ getLength() : double
```

Parameter variables and their data types may be listed inside a member function’s parentheses. For example, the `Rectangle` class’s `setLength` function has a double parameter named `len`, so it could be listed as follows in the UML diagram:
```c++
+ setLength(len : double) : void
```
