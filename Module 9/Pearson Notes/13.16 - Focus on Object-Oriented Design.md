# 13.16 - Focus on Object-Oriented Design: Finding the Classes and their Responsibilities
So far, you have learned the basics of writing a class, creating an object from the class, and using the object to perform operations. This knowledge is necessary to create an object-oriented application, but it is not the first step in designing the application. The first step is to analyze the problem you are trying to solve and determine the classes you will need. In this section, we will discuss a simple technique for finding the classes in a problem and determining their responsibilities.

## Finding the Classes
When developing an object-oriented application, one of your first tasks is to identify the classes you will need to create. Typically, your goal is to identify the different types of real world objects that are present in the problem, then create classes for those types of objects within your application.
Over the years, software professionals have developed numerous techniques for finding the classes in a given problem. One simple and popular technique involves the following steps:
1) Get a written description of the problem domain.
2) Identify all the nouns (including pronouns and noun phrases) in the description. Each of these is a potential class.
3) Refine the list to include only the classes that are relevant to the problem.

# Write a Description of the Problem Domain
The **problem domain** is the set of real-world objects, parties, and major events related to the problem. If you adequately understand the nature of the problem you are trying to solve, you can write a description of the problem domain yourself. If you do not thoroughly understand the nature of the problem, you should have an expert write the description for you.

For example, suppose we are programming an application that the manager of Joe’s Automotive Shop will use to print service quotes for customers. Here is a description that an expert, perhaps Joe himself, might have written:

Joe’s Automotive Shop services foreign cars, and specializes in servicing cars made by Mercedes, Porsche, and BMW. When a customer brings a car to the shop, the manager gets the customer’s name, address, and telephone number. The manager then determines the make, model, and year of the car and gives the customer a service quote. The service quote shows the estimated parts charges, estimated labor charges, sales tax, and total estimated charges.

The problem domain description should include any of the following:
- Physical objects such as vehicles, machines, or products
- Any role played by a person, such as manager, employee, customer, teacher, student, and so on.
- The results of a business event, such as a customer order, or in this case, a service quote
- Recordkeeping items, such as customer histories and payroll records

# Identify All of the Nouns
The next step is to identify all of the nouns and noun phrases. (If the description contains pronouns, include them as well.) Here’s another look at the previous problem domain description. This time, the nouns and noun phrases appear in bold.

**Joe’s Automotive Shop** services **foreign cars**, and specializes in servicing **cars** made by **Mercedes**, **Porsche**, and **BMW**. When a **customer** brings a **car** to the **shop**, the **manager** gets the **customer’s name**, **address**, and **telephone number**. The **manager** then determines the **make**, **model**, and **year** of the **car**, and gives the **customer** a **service quote**. The **service quote** shows the **estimated parts charges**, **estimated labor charges**, **sales tax**, and **total estimated charges**.

Notice some of the nouns are repeated. The following list shows all of the nouns without duplicating any of them:
- address
- BMW
- car
- cars
- customer
- estimated labor charges
- estimated parts charges
- foreign cars
- Joe’s Automotive Shop
- make
- manager
- Mercedes
- model
- name
- Porsche
- sales tax
- service quote
- shop
- telephone number
- total estimated charges
- year

#### [BACK TO THE TOP](#Table-of-Contents)

# Refine the List of Nouns
The nouns that appear in the problem description are merely candidates to become classes. It might not be necessary to make classes for them all. The next step is to refine the list to include only the classes that are necessary to solve the particular problem at hand. We will look at the common reasons that a noun can be eliminated from the list of potential classes.

## Problem 1
1) **Some of the nouns really mean the same thing.**
In this example, the following sets of nouns refer to the same thing:
- **cars** and **foreign cars** 
	- These both refer to the general concept of a car.
- **Joe’s Automotive Shop** and **shop** 
	- Both of these refer to the company “Joe’s Automotive Shop.”

We can settle on a single class for each of these. In this example, we will arbitrarily eliminate **foreign cars** from the list, and use the word **cars**. Likewise, we will eliminate **Joe's Automotive Shop** from the list and use the word **shop**.

### **Word list update:**
- address
- BMW
- car
- cars
- customer
- estimated labor charges
- estimated parts charges
- make
- manager
- Mercedes
- model
- name
- Porsche
- sales tax
- service quote
- shop
- telephone number
- total estimated charges
- year
- 
## Problem 2
2) **Some nouns might represent items we do not need to be concerned with in order to solve the problem.**
A quick review of the problem description reminds us of what our application should do: print a service quote. In this example, we can eliminate two unnecessary classes from the list:
- We can cross **shop** off the list because our application only needs to be con­cerned with individual service quotes. It doesn’t need to work with or determine any companywide information. If the problem description asked us to keep a total of all the service quotes, then it would make sense to have a class for the shop.
- We will not need a class for the **manager** because the problem statement does not direct us to process any information about the manager. If there were multiple shop managers, and the problem description had asked us to record which manager generated each service quote, then it would make sense to have a class for the manager.

### **Word list update:**
- address
- BMW
- car
- cars
- customer
- estimated labor charges
- estimated parts charges
- make
- Mercedes
- model
- name
- Porsche
- sales tax
- service quote
- telephone number
- total estimated charges
- year

## Problem 3
3) **Some of the nouns might represent objects, not classes.**
We can eliminate **Mercedes**, **Porsche**, and **BMW** as classes because, in this example, they all represent specific **cars** and can be considered instances of a cars class. Also, we can eliminate the word **car** from the list. In the description, it refers to a specific car brought to the shop by a customer. Therefore, it would also represent an instance of a cars class.

### **Word list update:**
- address
- cars
- customer
- estimated labor charges
- estimated parts charges
- make
- model
- name
- sales tax
- service quote
- telephone number
- total estimated charges
- year

**NOTE:** Some object-oriented designers take note of whether a noun is plural or singular. Sometimes a plural noun will indicate a class, and a singular noun will indicate an object.

## Problem 4
4) **Some of the nouns might represent simple values that can be stored in a variable, and do not require a class**
Remember, a class contains attributes and member functions. Attributes are related items that are stored within an object of the class, and define the object’s state. Member functions are actions or behaviors that may be performed by an object of the class. If a noun represents a type of item that would not have any identifiable attributes or member functions, then it can probably be eliminated from the list. To help determine whether a noun represents an item that would have attributes and member functions, ask the following questions about it:
- Would you use a group of related values to represent the item's state?
- Are they any obvious actions to be preformed by the item?
If the answers to both of these questions are no, then the noun probably represents a value that can be stored in a simple variable. If we apply this test to each of the nouns that remain in our list, we can conclude that the following are probably not classes: **address, estimated labor charges, estimated parts charges, make, model, name, sales tax, telephone number, total estimated charges, and year**. These are all simple string or numeric values that can be stored in variables. 

### **Word list update:**
- cars
- customer
- service quote

We have eliminated **address, estimated labor charges, estimated parts charges, make, model, name, sales tax, telephone number, total estimated charges, and year** as classes because they represent simple values that can be stored in variables.

As you can see from the list, we have eliminated everything except cars, customer, and service quote. This means that in our application, we will need classes to represent cars, customers, and service quotes. Ultimately, we will write a `Car` class, a `Customer` class, and a `ServiceQuote` class.

# Identifying a Class's Responsibilities
Once the classes have been identified, the next task is to identify each class’s responsibilities. A class’s **responsibilities** are
- The things that the class is responsible for knowing.
- The actions that the class is responsible for doing.
When you have identified the things that a class is responsible for knowing, then you have identified the class’s attributes. Likewise, when you have identified the actions that a class is responsible for doing, you have identified its member functions.
It is often helpful to ask the questions “In the context of this problem, what must the class know? What must the class do?” The first place to look for the answers is in the description of the problem domain. Many of the things a class must know and do will be mentioned. Some class responsibilities, however, might not be directly mentioned in the problem domain, so brainstorming is often required. Let’s apply this methodology to the classes we previously identified from our problem domain.

#### [BACK TO THE TOP](#Table-of-Contents)

# The `Customer` Class
In the context of our problem domain, what must the `Customer` class know? The description directly mentions the following items, which are all attributes of a customer:
- The customer's name
- The customer's address
- The customer's telephone number
These are all values that can be represented as strings and stored in the class’s member variables. The Customer class can potentially know many other things. One mistake that can be made at this point is to identify too many things that an object is responsible for knowing. In some applications, a `Customer` class might know the customer’s e-mail address. This particular problem domain does not mention that the customer’s e-mail address is used for any purpose, so we should not include it as a responsibility.

Now let’s identify the class’s member functions. In the context of our problem domain, what must the `Customer` class do? The only obvious actions are to:
- Create an object of the `Customer` class
- Set and get the customer's name
- Set and get the customer's address
- Set and get the customer's telephone number.

## Figure 13-23

#### [BACK TO THE TOP](#Table-of-Contents)

# The `Car` Class
In the context of our problem domain, what must an object of the `Car` class know? The following items are all attributes of a car and are mentioned in the problem domain:
- The car’s make
- The car’s model
- The car’s year

Now let’s identify the class’s member functions. In the context of our problem domain, what must the `Car` class do? Once again, the only obvious actions are the standard set of member functions that we will find in most classes (constructors, accessors, and mutators). Specifically, the actions are:
- Create an object of the Car class
- Set and get the car’s make
- Set and get the car’s model
- Set and get the car’s year

## Figure 13-24
UML diagram for the `Car` Class <br />

#### [BACK TO THE TOP](#Table-of-Contents)

# The `ServiceQuote` Class
In the context of our problem domain, what must an object of the `ServiceQuote` class know? The problem domain mentions the following items:
-   The estimated parts charges
-   The estimated labor charges
-   The sales tax
-   The total estimated charges

Careful thought and a little brainstorming will reveal that two of these items are the results of calculations: sales tax, and total estimated charges. These items are dependent on the values of the estimated parts and labor charges. In order to avoid the risk of holding stale data, we will not store these values in member variables. Rather, we will provide member functions that calculate these values and return them. The other member functions we will need for this class are a constructor and the accessors and mutators for the estimated parts charges and estimated labor charges attributes.

# This is Only the Beginning
You should look at the process that we have discussed in this section as merely a starting point. It’s important to realize that designing an object-oriented application is an iterative process. It may take you several attempts to identify all of the classes that you will need and determine all of their responsibilities. As the design process unfolds, you will gain a deeper understanding of the problem, and consequently you will see ways to improve the design.
