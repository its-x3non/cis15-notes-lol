# 16.3 - Focus on Software Engineering: Where to Start When Defining Templates
Quite often, it is easier to convert an existing function into a template than to write a template from scratch. With this in mind, you should start designing a function template by writing it first as a regular function. For example, the `swapVars` template in [Program 16-8](16.2%20-%20Function%20Templates.md#Program-16-8) would have been started as something like the following:
```c++
void swapVars(int& var1, int& var2)
{
  int temp;

  temp = var1;
  var1 = var2;
  var2 = temp;
}
```
Once this function is properly tested and debugged, converting it to a template is a simple process. First, the` template <typename T>` header is added, then all the references to `int` that must be changed are replaced with the data type parameter `T`.
